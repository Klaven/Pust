# Pust
A ping, and maybe other network tester.

### Getting Startedhttps://github.com/libpnet/libpnet
 - while currently there is not much to look at, this is the start of a low level networking utility, Mostly Iâ€™m doing this to learn Rust, but also to fulfill some of my current needs and hopefully be able to help others that have the same needs.

 - This is all built off the work done here https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet by awesome people.
